App Name: MEV Attack Monitor

Description:
MEV Attack Monitor is a Mini App that tracks potential MEV-related risks across blockchain networks. Monitor suspicious activities such as sandwich attacks, front-running, back-running, and abnormal mempool behavior. Receive real-time alerts when risky MEV patterns appear, helping users protect their transactions and understand network dynamics.

Key Features:
 • Real-time detection of MEV patterns (front-run, sandwich, back-run, etc.)
 • Alerts for suspicious mempool activity
 • Monitoring across multiple networks and DEX trading pairs
 • Historical MEV attack data and trend visualization
 • Dashboard to view active threats and risk levels

Use Case:
Ideal for traders, developers, and advanced DeFi users who want to avoid malicious MEV attacks, optimize transaction timing, and improve on-chain security awareness.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will need to be edited to satisfy your request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized representation of a blockchain network with nodes and connections, highlighting MEV attack monitoring. The image shows a central node labeled 'MEV Monitor' surrounded by smaller nodes representing different blockchain networks. Lines connect nodes, some highlighted in red to indicate potential attack vectors. The background is a subtle gradient from dark blue to black, giving a techy, secure feel. The overall composition conveys real-time monitoring and alerting of MEV risks.
